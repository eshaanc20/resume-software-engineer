\section*{Projects}

\textbf{GazeTracker (Capstone Project)}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item Collaborated with psychology researchers to develop a browser-based gaze estimation plugin in JavaScript using jsPsych, enabling real-time on-device gaze tracking without specialized hardware or video uploads
    \item Built a real-time pipeline combining a face detection model, a lightweight neural gaze estimation model (pitch/yaw), and user-specific calibration to predict on-screen coordinates at 30 FPS on consumer laptops
    \item Trained lightweight CNN models using PyTorch, deployed with ONNX for real-time on-device inference, built a calibration UI to collect runtime data for a local regression model to achieve $\sim$3° angular accuracy
