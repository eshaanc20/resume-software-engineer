\section*{Projects}

\textbf{GazeTracker (Capstone Project)}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item Collaborated with psychology researchers to develop a browser-based gaze estimation plugin in JavaScript using jsPsych, enabling real-time on-device gaze tracking without specialized hardware or video uploads
    \item Built a real-time gaze estimation pipeline using face detection model, a custom-trained neural network to predict 3D gaze vector, and a runtime-trained regression model for user-specific calibration, achieving 30 FPS
    \item Trained lightweight CNN models using PyTorch, deployed with ONNX for real-time on-device inference, built a calibration UI to collect data for a local regression model and achieved angular error of less than 3 degrees
